Electricity Bill Predictor

A machine learning model developed in Google Colab to predict electricity bills based on various input parameters. This project uses Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

ðŸ“Œ Features

  - Data Preprocessing (Handling missing values, encoding, scaling)

  - Model Training & Evaluation (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)

  - Visualization of Predictions using Matplotlib

  - Performance Metrics Calculation (Accuracy, MAE, MSE, RMSE)

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

  - Electricity_bill_predictor.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with code implementation

  - README.md: Project documentation

ðŸš€ Getting Started

  Requirements:

  - Python 3.x

  - Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook

  - Pandas

  - NumPy

  - Scikit-Learn

  - Matplotlib

Installation

Clone the repository:

  ```$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/Electricity-Bill-Predictor.git```

Install the dependencies:

  ```$ pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib```

  Run the Notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

ðŸ“Š Results

  - Achieved an accuracy of 85% using Random Forest model.
